class ParentDocumentRetriever(MultiVectorRetriever):
    """Retrieve small chunks then retrieve their parent documents.

    When transform documents for retrieval, there are often conflicting desires:

    1. You may want to have small documents, so that their embeddings can most
        accurately reflect their meaning. If too long, then the embeddings can
        lose meaning.
    2. You want to have long enough documents that the context of each chunk is
        retained.

    The NewParentDocumentRetriever strikes that balance by transforming and storing
    small chunks of data. During retrieval, it first fetches the small chunks
    but then looks up the parent ids for those chunks and returns those larger
    documents.

    Note that "parent document" refers to the document that a small chunk
    originated from. This can either be the whole raw document OR a larger
    chunk.
